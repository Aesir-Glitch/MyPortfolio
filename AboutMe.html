<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is Neel and I'm 13 years old. I like to play video games and as well as play
sports outside. If you have seen my projects, then you also know that I do coding. I do mainly the
basic type of coding, nothing too fancy or hard. I also hoped you liked my projects.</p>
